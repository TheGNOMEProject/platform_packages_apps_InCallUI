platform_packages_apps_InCallUI
===============================

TheGnomeProject 

This feature is from OMNI ROM, this feature will modify the caller screen interface. 
Instead of a full screen it'll just look like a notification right above the navbar and it will not close the app you're 
currently viewing. 

Credits for the feature goes to the OMNI Devs.
